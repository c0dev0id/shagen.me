# About

Greetings, my name is Stefan Hagen. I'm currently employed at [SAP SE](https://www.sap.com) as project manager for the [BTP ABAP Environment](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/abap.html) Cloud Infrastructure. I'm also the president of the [Unix User Group Rhein Neckar e.V.](https://www.uugrn.org) and a developer at [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org). I'm located in [Hockenheim, Germany](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/453413).

I married an we have two cats. When I'm not hacking on anything, I'm likely on a motorcycle trip together with my wife or with people from the [Motorradfreunde Rhein-Neckar e.V.](https://motorradfreunde-rheinneckar.de).

Every once in a full moon, I'm [using my camera](https://stefanhagen-fotografie.de).
