# Articles

Sometimes I write about things.

I use the following syntax in my technical posts:
```
$           -> execute command as user
#           -> execute command as root
printf(3)   -> read the printf in section 3 (man 3 printf)
$filename   -> variable that's consistent within a post
<filename>  -> mandatory placeholder
[option]    -> optional placeholder
```
