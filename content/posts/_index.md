# Articles

Sometimes I write about things.

I use the following syntax in my technical posts:
```text
$ cmd     : execute command as user
# cmd     : execute command as root
printf(3) : read the printf in section 3 (man 3 printf)
$file     : variable that's consistent within a post
<file>    : mandatory placeholder
[option]  : optional placeholder
```
