# Articles

Sometimes, I write about things. 


I use the following syntax in my technical posts:
```text
$ cmd     : execute command as user
# cmd     : execute command as root
printf(3) : read the printf manpage in section 3 (man 3 printf)
$file     : variable that's consistent within the article
<file>    : mandatory placeholder
```
I don't target the beginner. I assume you know how to install software
and learn about unknown programs and commands.
