I'm an OpenBSD developer since 2021.

## Ports

I'm maintining some OpenBSD ports:

- [portroach](https://portroach.openbsd.org/stefan%20hagen%20%3Csh+ports@codevoid.de%3E.html): OpenBSD Port Tracker (uncheck "show only outdated" for the full list)
- [mystuff](https://git.uugrn.org/sdk/mystuff): My personal WIP repository
- [openbsd-wip](https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip): Collaboration WIP repository

## Distfiles

These files are used by OpenBSD ports and are not very useful when downloaded manually. However, they are useful to for me as a maintainer, and this is why this section exists.
